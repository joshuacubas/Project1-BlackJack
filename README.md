# Basic Idea

  - The main Objective is to get your cards total score to equal or be as close to 21 as possible.
  - There will be two human players and the computer shall be the card dealer.
  - Two cards will be randomly dealt to each player, including the dealer, from a 52 card deck. 
  - Human players will be given the choice to place bets and will be allowed to 'hit' or 'stand'. The dealer's turn to play cards will start once the human players have finished playing their turns and ended their hands.



### Cards

 - There will be 52 cards in the deck
 - each card will be given one of the following four suits; hearts, clubs, diamonds, or spades.
 - The cards will also have a number (2-9) or an Ace , Jack , Queen , or King value. 
 - Jack, Queen, and King all are worth ten
 - An Ace can be worth 1 'or' 11,  which ever is more in the hand's favor of winning.

### Winning

- BlackJacks are an automatic win. To have a BlackJack, th eplayer must initially be dealt an ace and any 10-point card. Unless the dealer also has a BlackJack, the player automatically wins.
- Having a larger sum up to 21 than the dealer.

### Draw

- If no hand is higher than another or all hands respectively total over 21, there is no winner.

### Losing

- If dealer hand's total score is worth over 21, yours is under, you lose
- if your hand goes over 21, and dealer's does not, you lose

# Gameplay
#
1. The games starts by adding 52 cards into a deck.
2. Two player's hands and dealer hand are dealt.
3. Each player start off with one hundred tokens, and chooses to places their bets.
4. Each player is dealt two cards face up.
5. Player two chooses "hit" and accept another card, may choose to do so multiple times, and/or "stay" and ends turn.
6. If total hand score ever goes over 21, player One 'busts' and the next player, if none the dealer, plays next.
7. once player player two's turn is over, player two's hit/stay buttons will dissapear and player one's hit/stay buttons will appear next. Once player one's turn end, player one's hit/stay buttons will dissapear.
8. Dealer's turn begins.If dealer's hand is under 12, dealer draws an additional card, if dealers hand is between 12 and 17 Dealer willchoose to "hit". If dealers hand is worth 18 or higher, dealer will choose to "stand". The dealers choice will cycle until breaking over 21 or having chosen to "stand"
9. If either player player has a BlackJack, and the dealer does not, player(s) beat the dealer and win.
10. Winning bets are doubled and added to winners banks, and deducted from losers banks
11. When player/dealer runs out of tokens to bet, the game is over and no more hands can be played.
